# Token Communication (TokenCom)

<div align="justify">

Token Communication (TokenCom) is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of Large AI Models (LAMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where **tokens are the unified units of computations and communications**, enabling efficient semantic- and goal-oriented communications in future wireless networks. TokenCom addresses the **lack of generalizability** gap in the conventional semantic- and goal-oriented communications. Tokens are the **universal semantic carrying units** in TokenCom that unify modalities and generalize beyonds tasks and datasets. Tokens are the basic processing units of text, images, audio/video signals, in SOTA LAMs and MLLMs that represent words, image patches, temporal audio slices, or video subframes, and capture the semantic content of different modalities in a similar way, i.e. through **information-rich features in a pre-trained cross-modal shared vector embedding space.** TokenCom applies **large transformer-based signal processing** for efficient encoding/decoding of the semantic content, to achieve **ultra-low bitrate SemCom** leveraging the context information between tokens in the same vicinity or across modalities. Fig. 1 below depicts the basic TokenCom framework.
